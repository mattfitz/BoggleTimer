# BoggleTimer
A shitty timer app for a Boggle variant I created. 
Rather than simultaneously writing down words, two placers face off using a chess-style timer, 
each trying to find the longest word within their allotted time. They may use all their time up at once; 
or, pass to the other player and conserve time. 
When one player's time runs out the other player's time will start running automatically, 
giving them the opportunity to look last. In other words, this is a chess timer that runs out both clocks.

It functions like a chess timer.

Swiping on the center area adjusts the time up or down.
Double-clicking on the center area resets both timers.
